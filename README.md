# chatprogram
A chat program, this is basically a version 2.0 of my insultgadget project, I just felt that it would be better under a new name.

I have tried my best to organise the files nicely so that they are easy to understand should anybody want to fork this project.

This project will evolve alongside my knowledge of python, if you see things that I could have done better, feel free to make a pull request, but remember that I am still learning :)
